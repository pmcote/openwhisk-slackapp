# A serverless Slack app built with IBM Cloud Functions and Slack Events API

This sample shows how to build a serverless Slack app using Slack Events API to receive events,
with IBM Cloud Functions to process these events.

> A previous version of this sample was using API Connect to expose the actions as HTTP endpoints. With the introduction of web actions in Cloud Functions this was no longer needed. You can browse [this tag](https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/openwhisk-slackapp/tree/using-api-connect) to view the code using API Connect.

## Overview

Built using IBM Bluemix, the app uses:
* Cloud Functions - to implement the app bot and commands
* Cloudant - to keep track of app installations
* and Slack Events API.

When a user installs the app in a Slack team, or interacts with a bot user, or uses a custom command, Slack calls the app implementation. Slack will talk directly with IBM Cloud Functions.

From the perspective of the developer of the Slack app, there is no server involved, only actions in a serverless environment. Furthermore the code is not running if no user interacts with the app and if the app gets popular, it will benefit from IBM Cloud Functions scalability.

In this sample, we will:
* create the Slack app in Slack,
* prepare the Cloud Functions environment, creating the actions implementing our Slack app,
* complete the integration by updating the endpoints in the Slack app,
* add our Slack app to a Slack team,
* test our Slack app.

## Requirements

To deploy this app, you need:
* IBM Bluemix account. [Sign up](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/?cm_mmc=GitHubReadMe) for Bluemix, or use an existing account.
* Slack account
* The [Bluemix CLI](https://clis.ng.bluemix.net/) and the [Cloud Functions plugin](https://clis.ng.bluemix.net/ui/repository.html#bluemix-plugins)

Your own Slack team is recommended if you want to play with the integration without impacting others.

## Create the Slack app

1. Proceed to the [new app creation](https://api.slack.com/apps/new) in Slack

1. Type a name for your app, select your Slack team.

1. Click Create

   ![](xdocs/app-created.png)

1. View the App Credentials

   ![](xdocs/app-verificationtoken.png)

We will need the Client ID, Client Secret and Verification Token in the next steps.

At this stage, we will put the configuration of the Slack app on hold.
For the next app configuration steps to work we need to have our actions up and running.

## Deploy the IBM Cloud Functions

### Get the code

* Clone the app to your local environment from your terminal using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/openwhisk-slackapp.git
   ```

* or Download and extract the source code from [this archive](https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/openwhisk-slackapp/archive/master.zip)

### Create the Bluemix Cloudant service

1. Open the IBM Bluemix console

1. Create a Cloudant NoSQL DB service instance named **cloudant-for-slackapp**

1. Open the Cloudant service dashboard and create a new database named **registrations**

1. Select the database

1. Create a new document.

1. Replace the default JSON with the content of the file [cloudant-designs.json](cloudant-designs.json)

   ![](xdocs/cloudant-adddesigndoc.png)

### Deploy from Linux or macOS

1. Copy the file named **template.local.env** into **local.env**

   ```
   cp template.local.env local.env
   ```

1. To get the service credentials, go to the Bluemix UI in your browser and select the service you are using.  Select service credentials and then view credentials to see the URL with the correct username and password. Set CLOUDANT_url in `local.env` to the corresponding value (url). Make sure you take the full url including the username and password https://username:password@hostname.cloudant.com.

1. Set the values for SLACK_CLIENT_ID, SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET, SLACK_VERIFICATION_TOKEN - these are the App Credentials we've seen in the previous steps.

1. Ensure your `bx wsk` command line interface is property configured with:

   ```
   bx wsk list
   ```

   This shows the packages, actions, triggers and rules currently deployed in your namespace.

1. Create the actions:

   ```
   ./deploy.sh --install
   ```

   If all goes well it outputs:

   ```
   Creating slackapp package
   ok: created package slackapp
   Adding app registration command
   ok: created action slackapp/slackapp-register
   Adding app event processing
   ok: created action slackapp/slackapp-event
   Adding app command processing
   ok: created action slackapp/slackapp-command
   OAuth URL:
   https://openwhisk.ng.bluemix.net/api/v1/web/<org_space>/slackapp/slackapp-register
   Command URL:
   https://openwhisk.ng.bluemix.net/api/v1/web/<org_space>/slackapp/slackapp-command
   Event Subscription Request URL:
   https://openwhisk.ng.bluemix.net/api/v1/web/<org_space>/slackapp/slackapp-event
   ```

   > Note: the script can also be used to *--uninstall* the Cloud Functions artifacts to *--update* the artifacts if you change the action code, or simply with *--env* to show the environment variables set in **local.env**.

### Deploy from Windows

1. Copy the file named **template.local.cmd** into **local.cmd**

   ```
   copy template.local.cmd local.cmd
   ```

1. Get the service credentials for the Cloudant service created above and set CLOUDANT_url
in `local.cmd` to the corresponding value (url). Make sure you take the full url including the username and password https://username:password@hostname.cloudant.com.

1. Set the values for SLACK_CLIENT_ID, SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET, SLACK_VERIFICATION_TOKEN - these are the App Credentials we've seen in the previous steps.

1. Ensure your `bx wsk` command line interface is property configured with:

   ```
   bx wsk list
   ```

   This shows the packages, actions, triggers and rules currently deployed in your namespace.

1. Create the actions:

   ```
   deploy.cmd --install
   ```

   If all goes well it outputs:

   ```
   Creating slackapp package
   ok: created package slackapp
   Adding app registration command
   ok: created action slackapp/slackapp-register
   Adding app event processing
   ok: created action slackapp/slackapp-event
   Adding app command processing
   ok: created action slackapp/slackapp-command
   ```

   > Note: the script can also be used to *--uninstall* the Cloud Functions artifacts to *--update* the artifacts if you change the action code, or simply with *--env* to show the environment variables set in **local.cmd**.

Our actions are ready. Back to the Slack app configuration.

## Complete the Slack app configuration

### Add a bot user

1. Go to the **Bot Users** section of your Slack app

   ![](xdocs/app-addbot.png)

1. Click **Add a Bot User**

1. Name your bot, check the option to have your bot always online and click **Add Bot User**

    ![](xdocs/app-botname.png)

### Add an Event Subscription

1. Go to the **Event Subscriptions** section of your app

1. Enable Events

   ![](xdocs/app-enableevents.png)

1. Set the Request URL to the URL of the `slack-event` web action. The URL should look like `https://openwhisk.ng.bluemix.net/api/v1/web/your-org_your-space/slackapp/slackapp-event`

   ![](xdocs/app-challengeaccepted.png)

   > Slack will contact this URL immediately. It should turn to **Verified** if the Cloud Functions configuration steps worked.

### Listen to Bot messages

1. Add a new Bot User Event for **message.im**

   ![](xdocs/app-addbotevent.png)

   > This allows us to react to direct messages sent to a bot. We could select more event type but for our simple app will only deal with this one today.

1. Save the changes

### Set the callback URL for authentication

1. Under OAuth and Permissions, add a new Redirect URL. This URL will be called when a user installs your application in a team. It should point to the `slackapp-register` web action. The URL should look like `https://openwhisk.ng.bluemix.net/api/v1/web/your-org_your-space/slackapp/slackapp-register`

   ![](xdocs/app-setoauth.png)

1. Click **Save Changes**

### Create a new command

1. Under Slash Commands, **Create New Command**

   ![](xdocs/app-newcommand.png)

1. Set the values

   1. Command: **/myserverlessapp**

   1. Request URL: URL of the `slackapp-command` web action. The URL should look like `https://openwhisk.ng.bluemix.net/api/v1/web/your-org_your-space/slackapp/slackapp-command`

   1. Short Description: **A test command**

   1. Usage Hint: **[param1] [param2]**

   ![](xdocs/app-commandsettings.png)

1. Save

Our app is finally ready to be installed!

## Add the app to your team

1. To see what's happening behind the scene as Slack calls our actions, open a new command prompt and run

   ```
   bx wsk activation poll
   ```

   > Leave it running. Actions triggered by Slack will show up there

1. Go to [Slack Add Button page](https://api.slack.com/docs/slack-button)

1. Scroll down to the **Add the Slack button** section

1. Pick you app from the dropdown list

1. **Uncheck incoming webhook**

1. **Check commands and bot**

   ![](xdocs/app-addtoslack.png)

1. Press **Add to Slack**

1. Select your team if needed

   ![](xdocs/app-install.png)

1. Authorize the app

   ![](xdocs/app-authorize.png)

   After a few seconds, the app is installed. You should see logs appearing in the activation   polling as Slack will be sending the registration info we will use later to interact with Slack channels and users.

   In your web browser, you should see `Registration was successful. You can try the command in Slack or send a direct message to the bot.`

   Ideally you would redirect to another page once the registration is completed.

## Test the integration

1. Go into your team in Slack

1. Send a direct message to our new bot friend

   ![](xdocs/team-newbot.png)

   ![](xdocs/team-startchatwithbot.png)

1. The bot replies

   ![](xdocs/team-botchat.png)

1. Go to the #general channel (although this could work from any place in Slack) and type ```/my``` you should see the custom command

   ![](xdocs/team-customcommand.png)

1. Try the command ```/myserverless two params``` as example

   ![](xdocs/team-customcommandoutput.png)

## Troubleshooting

### Cloud Functions

Polling activations is good start to debug the action execution. Run
```
bx wsk activation poll
```
and send a message to the bot or use a custom command.
